            She is a petulant woman miffed at a child’s pranks. She is the
            child, a minx, mischief and innocence bundled in gestures that are
            calibrated to endear. She is the mother, grace personified, who,
            while knowing what her child can do, chooses to chide the older
            woman for complaining about what is essentially a child’s harmless
            play. These three personalities are distinct and it comes as a
            stunning revelation for they are all emoted by the same person who
            artlessly segues from one character to another. The dexterity with
            which she wields her expressiveness is matched only by the way she
            wields her body as the instrument of her art. Both nritta and
            abhinaya are woven together in such a seamless manner that be it the
            harried milkmaid who complains about Krishna, little Krishna, or the
            unperturbed Yashoda, you always see only the character, never
            Pavithra Reddy.

            Such mastery over the art is only possible with decades made of
            days, which are made of hours of practice and rigour, and Pavithra
            Reddy knows first-hand what it means to devote oneself to the art,
            specifically, what it means to devote oneself to the art in the way
            it is done at Nrityagram.
          </p>
        <p>
            A resident of Hessaraghatta, Pavithra Reddy came to Nrityagram in
            1990, when she was all of 12-years-old. She was trained by <a href="/protima" class="bodylink">Protima
            Gauri</a> and <a href="/surupa" class="bodylink">Surupa Sen</a> as part of Nrityagram’s village outreach program.
            Her commitment and consistently stellar performance led her to be
            one of the youngest members of Nrityagram’s dance ensemble. She
            celebrated her sixteenth birthday while touring the United States
            with the ensemble.
          </p>
        <p>
            Since then, Pavithra Reddy has gone from strength to strength in her
            journey dedicated to dance. She has worked with dancers and movement
            specialists from across the globe. She has performed solo and as
            part of the Ensemble at some of the most prestigious venues across
            the world.
          </p>
        <p>
            Over the years, Pavithra has assumed another role, that of a teacher
            at Nrityagram. “I am going to hang you upside down on that tree,”
            she declares, and all the little ones giggle, and you will then find
            the teacher too laughing with her students. Pavi didi, as she is
            known to all her little ones, charms the students into doing what
            she wants them to, which is to love dance and pursue excellence in
            the art form.
          </p>

            Pavithra is Director of our Arts in Education activities and has devised various programmes to engage and enthuse our next generation of dancers.
