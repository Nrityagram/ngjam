					Lavanya Sankaran, author and patron of the arts, divides her time between Bangalore and New York, and depending on which side of the ocean life steers her, she finds comfort in idlis and Mysore coffee or jazz and bourbon. And home for her means libraries and golden retrievers.
				</p>
				<p>
					For Lavanya writing was always a constant in her life, as both medium and muse. Since she was a child, she wrote. Investment banking was a short detour, after which she again went back to her first love, writing.
				</p>
				<p>
					She is the author of the internationally acclaimed short story collection ‘The Red Carpet’, which was selected for Poets and Writers Magazine’s Best First Fiction award, as well as the Barnes and Noble Discover Great New Writers award. Her debut novel The Hope Factory, hit the Number 1 spot on Amazon India and was also selected by Amazon UK as a Top Pick.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lavanya’s writing is published in over 15 countries and her opinion pieces and fiction have appeared in The New York Times, The Guardian and The Atlantic, among others.

					Be it theatre, television or the silver screen, Lillette Dubey has won hearts and accolades of both audiences and critics for many decades now.

					She is on the Expert Committee of the Ministry of Culture, has curated the Serendipity Festival, and has been on the jury of several Theatre and Film festivals.
				</p>
				<p>
					When she is not in the thrall of her enduring love, theatre, she is happiest playing with her twin grand-daughters, Shaira and Niharika, reading, doing crosswords, playing Bridge and Scrabble, and traveling.

					Nitin Pujar is a keen student of the human condition. Insatiably curious, he watches people to study their motivations and behavior and is a keen problem solver. Adhering to the words of the bard, Nitin ‘finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks’, and so he converses with everyone, whether they are young or old. Keen to experience life in its infinite variety, he travels constantly, and tries to capture the ephemeral in his poetry.
				</p>
				<p>
					Nitin’s abiding interest in studying people led him to create MACRO (Market Analysis & Consumer Research Organisation), where he is a Managing Partner. He also serves as a Principal Consultant at MAVEN Advisors, a strategy Advisory Practice based in Mumbai. He has worked on strategy, sales implementation as well as brand and communications program development projects in the area of banking & financial services, non‐profit organizations, information technology companies and various medium and small enterprises.

					Sridhar Mahadevan seeks to understand the fundamental principles of the universe, be it in terms of underlying order or manifest expression. Fueled by his curiosity about how the universe works, he opted for a dual degree course that combined electrical engineering and a post-graduate program in physics at BITS Pilani. He went on to become a Co-Founder and Chief Operating Officer of iLink Systems, which is a multi-million dollar software services firm, headquartered in Redmond, WA, USA.
				</p>
				<p>
					He was introduced to dance by his mother, a Bharatanatyam practitioner. As an adult, he underwent formal training in Bharatanatyam and Kalaripayattu. He became an ardent rasika, attending as many dance concerts as he could, and voraciously read on theory and dance forms across the world.
				</p>
				<p>
					His abiding interest in movement, as both a student and rasika, led him to knock on the doors of Nrityagram. In 2009, he began volunteering with Nrityagram and assisting with social media outreach and logistics of performance. Committed to Nrityagram’s nurture and growth, he works with the organisation in different capacities.
				</p>
